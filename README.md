# Bayesian-evolvability-NCII
R code and data to produce the analyses and plots in the manuscipt Powell JA, Archer, FI, Burgess SC. Evolvability of larval dispersal traits in a marine invertebrate. 

Code run in R but requires the installation of JAGS (https://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.io/)

Bayesian analysis of Molgula occidentalis (ascidian) larval traits from a North Carolina II (NCII) breeding design.

All code written by Eric Archer (https://github.com/EricArcher), except ###.

Raw data in Moccidentalis All Traits.csv
Model I = File names starting with 2
Model II = File names starting with 4
Model III = File names starting with 3
Model IV = File names starting with 5
